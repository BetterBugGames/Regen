## Regen - An interactive fiction game by Better Bug Games

Mostly this is here as an experiment for me to learn not only Laravel but how things work with interactive fiction.

This will be a series of IFGs where I play around with different styles, actions, etc. to see how it works.

Hope you enjoy!
